# Custom Factory.ai Droid Commands

This directory contains custom slash commands for the Factory.ai droid CLI. These commands are project-specific and shared with all team members.

## How Commands Work

- Commands are Markdown files with optional YAML frontmatter
- The `$ARGUMENTS` variable expands to everything typed after the command name
- Commands are automatically discovered on CLI launch
- Press `R` in the `/commands` UI to reload without restarting

## Adding New Commands

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Add optional YAML frontmatter with `description` and `argument-hint`
3. Write your command template using `$ARGUMENTS` for parameter substitution
4. The filename becomes the command slug (e.g., `my-command.md` â†’ `/my-command`)
